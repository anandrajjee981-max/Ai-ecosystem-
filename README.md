# Ai-ecosystem-
Excited to share Version 1.0 of my C++ project – AI Ecosystem 🚀

This project is a console-based multi-feature system built completely using core C++ fundamentals.
Even before completing advanced DSA, I focused on real-world logic, modular design, and user-centric flow.

🔹 Current Features (Version 1.0)

✅ AI Goal Optimizer – Distributes available time across tasks based on priority and tracks user accuracy
✅ AI Style Study Scheduler – Creates a personalized study timetable using subject difficulty scaling
✅ AI Wellness Assistant – Calculates BMI & calories burnt and provides health/meal advice
✅ AI Virtual Companion – A basic rule-based chatbot for greetings, jokes, and interaction

⭐ What makes this project special

Multiple features can run in any order using a single input

Function-based modular design instead of one long main()

Real-life inspired logic (time management, productivity, health)

Built with pure C++ (no frameworks, no libraries)

Focused on thinking + problem-solving, not just syntax


🔄 What’s next?

This is Version 1.0.
After completing DSA and strengthening OOP concepts, I’ll upgrade this project with:

Better data structures

Cleaner architecture

Optimized logic

More intelligent decision-making


Learning → Building → Improving.
Version by version. 💻🔥
